A Reddit bot in Python.

A bot is a software program that can interact with websites autonomously.  This means they run according to their instructions without needing a human user to interact with or  manually start them up every time.

The bot runs in the background and monitors a website. When it sees a change (like a post on Reddit), it can reply to it, upvote, or do any other task it was programmed to.
